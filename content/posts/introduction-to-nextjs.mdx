# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building web applications a breeze. In this guide, we'll explore the key features that make Next.js stand out.

## Key Features

### 1. File-System Based Routing

Next.js uses the file system for routing. Simply create a file in the `pages` directory, and it becomes a route:

```jsx
// pages/about.js
export default function About() {
  return <h1>About Page</h1>
}
```

### 2. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Next.js supports multiple rendering strategies:

```jsx
// SSR Example
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  const data = await res.json()
  
  return {
    props: { data }
  }
}
```

### 3. Static Site Generation (SSG)

```jsx
// SSG Example
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const posts = await getPosts()
  
  return {
    props: {
      posts
    }
  }
}
```

## Getting Started

1. Create a new Next.js app:
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Best Practices

- Use the App Router for new projects
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Optimize images with next/image
- Use proper TypeScript types
