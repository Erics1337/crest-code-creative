# Introduction to MDX

MDX is a powerful format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

## Why MDX?

MDX combines the best of both worlds:
- Write content in Markdown syntax
- Use React components when you need more functionality

## Code Example

```jsx
import { Chart } from './components/Chart'

# My MDX Page

Here's a chart:

<Chart data={[1, 2, 3]} />
```

## Features

1. **Component Import**: Import and use React components
2. **Markdown Syntax**: Use familiar Markdown syntax
3. **JSX Integration**: Seamlessly mix JSX and Markdown
4. **Custom Components**: Create and use custom components

## Using Components

You can import and use components directly in your MDX files. This allows you to create rich, interactive content that goes beyond what traditional Markdown can offer.

## Conclusion

MDX is a fantastic tool for creating content-rich pages with interactive elements. It's perfect for:
- Documentation
- Blog posts
- Technical articles
- Interactive tutorials
